# ðŸŒ¸  Iris Dataset â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis

This was my first data analysis project, using the classic Iris dataset. It helped me explore the fundamentals of working with data in Python â€” especially using Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization. Looking back at it now, I clearly see how much Iâ€™ve grown in terms of understanding data structures, building insight, and communicating findings. This project laid the foundation for my later work in machine learning and full data science pipelines.


## Problem

Before diving into machine learning, I wanted to develop a feel for how to explore and understand data. This project allowed me to study real-world structure in a small, clean dataset, and to start thinking analytically about features and targets.

## My Role

- Led all steps of the analysis, from data loading and cleaning to visualization and interpretation.
- Designed visualizations to explore species-level patterns and feature relationships.
- Documented the workflow as a structured EDA report (now presented as slides).

---

## Key Features

- Summary statistics and feature distributions
- Correlation matrix
- Feature comparison across classes
- Class separation in feature space

---

## Tools & Technologies

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, nbconvert (slides)

---

## Key Insights

- Petal-related features (length, width, area) are the strongest indicators of species.
- Clear class separation is visible between Setosa and the other two species.
- High correlations were observed between several features, especially:
  - Petal length & Petal width: **r = 0.96**
  - Sepal length & Petal length: **r = 0.87**
- Dataset was clean (no missing values), with 3 duplicates and a few mild outliers in Setosa group.
- Created a derived feature: **petal area**, which enhanced visual comparison across classes.
