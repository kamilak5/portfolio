# Welcome to my page!

My name is Kamila, I'm a **data scientist** with a background in **cognitive science**, focused on creating intelligent, 
user-aware systems that combine technical precision with human-centered design. 
My interdisciplinary foundation gives me a strong base and I'm excited to keep learning, 
exploring new tools and methods to solve meaningful problems.

I help teams turn data into actionable insight, working at the intersection of machine learning, 
human-centered design, and LLM integration. If you're looking to **improve predictions, 
personalize user experience, or prototype AI-driven solutions** - you're in the right place.

Here youâ€™ll find a selection of my projects, including **end-to-end ML applications, EDA project, 
and user-focused prototypes.** Each project reflects my commitment to thoughtful design, 
clean data pipelines, and meaningful impact.
