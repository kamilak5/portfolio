## AI Language Learning App with GPT-4o (Conversational Tutor)

# Project description 

Developed an interactive web app that supports language learners through advanced AI tools. Users can correct grammar, translate text, generate paraphrases with explanations, take CEFR-level grammar quizzes, and chat with an AI tutor.
Built with Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT-4o, the app features:

- Dynamic cost and token usage tracking
- Secure API key handling
- Multilingual interface (Polish, English, Catalan)
- Prompt templating and JSON-based feedback for explainability
- Scalable architecture ready for ASR (Whisper) and TTS (gTTS) integration

The project showcases practical use of LLMs in EdTech, focusing on user experience and modular design for future expansion.


## Project Summary
A real-time, interactive language learning tool powered by GPT-4o. The app helps users practice conversation, get corrections, learn context-based vocabulary, and receive tailored feedback — all aligned with CEFR language proficiency levels.

## Problem
Most language apps are rigid and template-based, with limited adaptability to learner needs. This project explores how LLMs can simulate real-life conversation, provide feedback, and personalize learning based on behavior and CEFR levels.

## My Role
Designed the system architecture and conversational logic
Integrated GPT-4o for real-time tutoring
Designed CEFR-based complexity modulation
Prototyped and tested UI for clarity and usability
## Key Features
CEFR-Aware Conversational Engine

Custom prompts guide GPT-4o to match user’s CEFR level (A1–C1)
Users choose topic and their level to get content and materials (e.g., “art”, "ecology")
LLM adapts vocabulary, grammar, tone to match level
Intelligent Error Correction

After each exchange, GPT-4o highlights grammar and usage errors
Explains mistakes in simple English
Adaptive Learning

## Tools & Technologies
Python, OpenAI GPT-4o API, Streamlit, CEFR-based logic tree

## Outcomes
Simulated a private language tutor using AI, lowering access barriers to high-quality conversation practice
Feedback showed high user engagement due to personalization and friendliness of feedback
Demonstrated practical, scalable use of LLMs in edtech
