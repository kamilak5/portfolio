# Welcome to my page!

Hi, Iâ€™m Kamila, I'm a **researcher** and **analyst** with a background in **cognitive science** and **data science**. I explore how people interact with systems, products, and information - turning complex questions into evidence-based insights and intelligent solutions.
Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and always eager to explore new tools, methods, and perspectives to solve meaningful problems.

With an interdisciplinary mindset, I connect data, user behavior, and technology to inform decisions, improve experiences, and prototype impactful tools - from UX research and analytics to machine learning and LLM-powered systems. Whether itâ€™s uncovering user needs, validating assumptions, or transforming data into strategy, I bring clarity, empathy, and analytical depth.

Here youâ€™ll find a selection of my projects, including **end-to-end ML application, a credit risk prediction model and 
an AI-powered language learning app.** Each project reflects my commitment to thoughtful design, 
clean data pipelines, and meaningful impact.
