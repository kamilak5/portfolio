# Welcome to my page!

I'm a **data scientist** with a background in **cognitive science**, focused on creating intelligent, user-aware systems that combine technical precision with human-centered design. My interdisciplinary foundation gives me a strong base and I'm excited to keep learning, exploring new tools and methods to solve meaningful problems.

I help teams turn data into actionable insight, working at the intersection of machine learning, human-centered design, and LLM integration. If you're looking to **improve predictions, personalize user experience, or prototype AI-driven solutions** – you're in the right place.

Here you’ll find a selection of my projects, including **end-to-end ML applications, EDA project, and user-focused prototypes.** Each project reflects my commitment to thoughtful design, clean data pipelines, and meaningful impact.
